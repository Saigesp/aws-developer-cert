# AWS Direct Connect

Links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over ethernet.

Allow establish a dedicated connection from an on-prem network to one or more VPCs in the same region.

### Limitations

Direct Connect lets you establish 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps dedicated network connections (or multiple connections) between AWS networks and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations.

You can also work with your provider to create sub-1G connection or use link aggregation group (LAG) to aggregate multiple 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit connections at a single AWS Direct Connect endpoint, allowing you to treat them as a single, managed connection.
