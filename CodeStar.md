# AWS CodeStar

Cloud-based service for creating, managing, and working with software development projects on AWS.

## Diferences with CodePipeline

CodeStar itâ€™s just an overlay to the [CodeCommit](CodeCommint.md)/git, [CodeBuild](CodeBuild.md), [CodePipeline](CodePipeline.md), and [CodeDeploy](CodeDeploy.md) services using predefined templates to simplify the orchestration.
