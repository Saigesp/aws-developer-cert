# AWS S3 - Simple Storage Service

AWS Object Storage Service.

#### Main features:

- Object based (it can't edit one chunk of the file, it treats the file as a whole)
- Provides a Rest and a SOAP (deprecated) interfaces

### Definitions:

- **Objects**:
    - Entities stored in S3 (image, audio, files...).
    - Objects data and its metadata.
    - The object created in a region never leaves that region (you can transfer or replicate it (CRR)).
- **Bucket**:
    - A container that stores objects.
    - Bucket have regions but can be globally accessed.
- **Endpoint**:
    - URL entry point for a web service. (Most AWS offer a regional entry point).
- **Key**:
    - Objects unique identifier. The bucket, key (and optional version) identifies an object.

### S3 vs EFS vs EBS

- S3 is object storage designed for multiple purposes, **not limited to [EC2](EC2.md)**.
- [EFS](EFS.md) provides scalable network file storage for [EC2](EC2.md) service users.
- [EBS](EBS.md) is block storage for [EC2](EC2.md) instances (like a hard drive).


## ARN

The following common Amazon Resource Name ([ARN](ARN.md)) format identifies resources in AWS:

```
arn:{partition}:s3:{region}:{namespace}:{relative-id}
```

The following ARN identifies the `/dev/info.doc` object in the `lorem` bucket:

```
arn:aws:s3:::lorem/dev/info.doc
```

The following identifies all objects under prefix `05/hr` for access point `test` in account `123456789012` in `us-east-2` region
```
arn:aws:s3:us-east-2:123456789012:accesspoint/test/object/05/hr/*`
```

## Storage classes

| | Standard | Intelligent-Tiering | Standard-IA | One Zone-IA | Glacier | Glacier Deep Archive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | General | Cost optimization | Infrequently access | Infrequently access | Long-term low-cost | Long-term low-cost |
| Replication (AZ) | >= 3 | >= 3 | >= 3 | 1 | >= 3 | >= 3 |
| Availability | 99.99% | 99.9% | 99.9% | 99.5% | Minutes | 12 hours |

### Special characteristics

- **S3 Standard**
    - Low latency and high throughput.
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**
    - Moves no accessed objects automatically to lower tiers.
    - Charges a monthly monitoring and automation fee.
- **S3 Standard-IA (Standard Infrecuent Access)**
    - Good for less frequent accessed objects.
- **S3 One Zone-IA**
    - Good option for secondary backups.
- **S3 Glacier**
    - Good option for rarely accessed data.
- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**
    - Lowest cost but longest retrieval time than Glacier.

### Object Lifecycle Management

Manages the storage of objects and it associated costs. Is used to manage the storage classes of the object depending upon it usage (Transition) or its expiration time (Expiration).

### Limitations

- **5,500 GET** requests **per second per partitioned prefix** in a **bucket**.
- **3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE** requests **per second per partitioned prefix** in a **bucket**
- There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket.
- You can increase your read or write performance by using parallelization.

## Data consistency model

#### Definitions:

- **Read after Write Consistent**: "Consistent".
- **Eventually Read after Write Consistent**: S3 will provide the final data when the object is finally created.
- **Eventually Consistent**: S3 may take some time to provide the final data.

#### How S3 handles data consistency:

- **New object**: "Read after Write Consistent".
- **Read while creating**: "Eventually Read after Write Consistent". 
- **Update object**: "Eventually Consistent".
- **Delete object**: "Eventually Consistent".

## Versioning

Allows to mantain multiple versions of an object in the same bucket.

Deleteion can be MFA required.

### States:

- **Un-versioned**. Default. Objects has null version ID.
- **Versioning-enabled**. Deleted objects have a "Deleted mark".
- **Versioning-suspended**.

## Object retrieval

### Typical time for data retreival

### Select from objects using Queries

Extract records from an stored CSV or JSON file using SQL expressions. Also supports GZIP compressed files.

## Object upload

### Transfer Acceleration

Enables file transfers over long distances. Useful when:

- Customers needs to upload files worldwide to a centralized bucket.
- Transfer large amounts of data across continents on a regular basis.
- The available upload bandwidth is underutilized.

### Multipart Upload

Enables upload of large objects (>100MB) in parts.

It's required for files larger than **5GB**, and limited to files of **5TB**.

## Events

S3 can send notifications when some event occurs in your bucket.

Events can be sent to:

- [SNS](SNS.md).
- [SQS](SQS.md).
- [Lambda](Lambda.md).

## Encryption

Can be server-side (SSE) or client-side (CSE). Server-side uses AES-256.

To server-side encrypt an object at rest, the request should include the header `x-amz-server-side-encryption`. A bucket policy can be created to deny all other requests.

Starting January 5, 2023, all new object uploads to S3 will be automatically encrypted with SSE-S3 at no additional cost.

### Encryption types
- **SSE (server-side)**.
    - **SSE-S3**.
        - AWS S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3).
    - **SSE-KMS**.
        - [KMS](KMS.md) Managed Keys (SSE-KMS).
        - Allows to have separated permissions for the use of the envelope key and audit it use.
    - **SSE-C**.
        - Custom Provided Keys. Encryption keys are managed by the customer. Discouraged.
- **CSE (client side)**.
    - **AWS-KMS-managed key**.
        - [KMS](KMS.md) Managed Keys (SSE-KMS).
    - **Client-side Master Key**.

## Access Control List (ACL)

Manage access on buckets and objects. Now it is **advised to disable it** except for special cases.

### Access Analyzer

Can be enabled to get a list of all buckets with public access.

It provides the following information:
- Bucket name
- Discovered by Access analyzer
- Shared through
- Status
- Access Level

## Cross-Region Replication (CRR)

Automatic asynchronous copy of objects between regions.

Multiple rules can be added based upon the subset of objects to be matched. Can be based on:
- Objects tag.
- Object key prefixes.
- Any combination of both.

#### Notes:
- It replicates objects, metadata and tags.
- It not replicate replicas.
- Only applies to new objects since the replication config is set.
- Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.
- Permissions & Security:
    - S3 must have permissions to replicate objects from the origin to the destination bucket on your behalf (rule must be created). For cross-account scenario, create a [IAM Role](IAM.md#roles).
    - Only replicates objects for which the bucket owner has permissions to read objects and Access Control List.
    - It works with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS encryption.
- Deletion:
    - Without versioning, S3 adds a delete marker and replicates to the destination.
    - With versioning, S3 deletes the objects version but does not replicate the deletion in the destination.

## Static Website Hosting

In bucket properties we can set a bucket as an HTML static page with an index and an error page.

Remember to enable CORS it it will be accessed from a differente domain!

## Logging

### Server access logging

- Provides records for the buckets requests.
- Disabled by default.
- Source and target bucket should be in the same region.
- S3 Log Delivery must have permission to write on the target bucket.
- Delivered on a "Best Effort Basis" (most within a few hours).

### Object level logging

- Provides records for the objects requests.
- It's enabled on bucket level.
- Requires [CloudTrail](CloudTrail.md) service setup.
- Leverages [CloudTrail](CloudTrail.md) service offerings.

## Object lock

Object locks apply to a specific version of an object in a versioned bucket.

Prevents accidental or inappropriate deletion of data.

## Inventories

Multiple Inventory lists can be created for a bucket with inventory files saved in encrypted format.

## Batch Operations

For creating Job request, the following parameters need to be specified:

- Operation
- Manifest
- Priority
- RoleArn
- Report
- Tags (optional)
- Description (optional)

## Best practices
- Security:
    - Disable access control lists (ACLs).
    - Use policies and disable public access.
    - Implement least privilege access.
    - Consider encryption of data at rest.
    - Enforce encryption of data in transit (HTTPS (TLS)).
        - Use the `aws:SecureTransport` condition on bucket policies.
    - Consider S3 Object Lock
- Performance:
    - Use [CloudFront](CloudFront.md) or [ElastiCache](ElastiCache.md) for caching.
    - Use Transfer Acceleration for data transport over long distances.
    - Control [KMS](KMS.md) limits if you are using server-side with KMS (SSE-KMS).
    - Retry Requests for Latency-Sensitive Applications
