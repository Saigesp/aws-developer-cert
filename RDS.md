# AWS RDS - Relational Database Service

Service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud.

## DB Instances

A DB instance is an isolated database environment running in the cloud.

You can have up to 40 Amazon RDS DB instances, with the following limitations:
- 10 for each SQL Server edition (Enterprise, Standard, Web, and Express) under the "license-included" model.
- 10 for Oracle under the "license-included" model.
- 40 for MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL.
- 40 for Oracle under the "bring-your-own-license" (BYOL) licensing model.

## DB Instance Classes

The DB instance class determines the computation and memory capacity of an Amazon RDS DB instance.

## DB Instance Storage

Amazon RDS provides three storage types:
- General Purpose SSD (also known as gp2 and gp3).
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (also known as io1).
- Magnetic (also known as standard).

## Logs

The AWS RDS Service contains several logs types:

- Error log
    - Contains diagnostic messages generated by the database engine, along with startup and shutdown times.
- General query log
    - Contains a record of all SQL statements received from clients and client connect and disconnect times.
- Slow query log
    - Contains a record of SQL statements that took longer to execute than a set amount of time and that examined more than a defined number of rows. Both thresholds are configurable.
